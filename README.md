👨‍💻 I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always seek to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the business. I always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to the company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest impact. Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.

As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous learning and improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail perspective, integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such as hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.

I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.
