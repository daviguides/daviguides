# About Me

<img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="Davi Picture" align="right" style="width: 150px"/>

Hi, I'm **Davi** — a **Staff Software Engineer** with over 21 years of experience in backend systems, platform resilience, and data engineering.

I specialize in **Python**, **SQL**, **AWS**, and **cloud-native architectures**, focusing on delivering **scalable**, **resilient**, **high-performance**, and **secure solutions** that drive real business value.

## 🚀 Core Expertise

- **Backend Engineering**: 17+ years with Python. FastAPI, Flask, Django, SQL, Celery, RabbitMQ.
- **Cloud & Platform Engineering**: 13+ years with AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, Redshift, CloudWatch, SQS, SNS).
- **Data Engineering & Analytics**: MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Polars, Jupyter.
- **Infrastructure & CI/CD**: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Key Strengths

- **Architecture & System Design**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD), clean architecture, scalable system patterns.
- **Leadership & Ownership**: Leading cross-functional teams, aligning platform initiatives, mentoring engineers.
- **Data-Driven Mindset**: Advocate for pragmatic, measurable, resilient solutions.
- **Platform Resilience**: Enabling observability, predictive alerting, fault tolerance, and sustainable optimization.

## 📘 Philosophy

> **Awareness, Responsibility, Care.**
> The real foundations of lasting systems, strong teams, and meaningful work.

- **Sobriety without heaviness**: Elegance rooted in simplicity and clarity.
- **Naturalness without obviousness**: Organic systems, authentic structures, resilient designs.
- **Discipline without rigidity**: Structure that breathes, order that adapts, systems that serve human growth.
- **Care as grounded attention**: Not blind trust, not fear — but mindful engagement with reality.

I believe that **divergence strengthens resilience** — in code, in architectures, in teams, and ultimately in society and culture.
When we build with **intention**, we don't just create robust systems — we cultivate healthier, more adaptable environments where both technology and people can thrive.

This isn’t about ideology; it’s about reality:
**Nature thrives through diversity. So do the best systems — and the best communities.**

Presence that is:

- Calm but fully awake.
- Strong but gently adaptable.
- Sophisticated but genuinely accessible.
- Curious but grounded in action.

In work and in life, I seek the quiet strength of systems that **breathe, adapt, and endure** — whether they are architectures, teams, communities, or personal journeys.

**Nothing endures without care.**
**Nothing evolves without responsibility.**
**No mastery endures without humility.**

## ✨ Guiding Quote

> _“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.”_  
> — **Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind**

Still learning how to express many possibilities in just a few words — the paradox of a curious mind growing through simplicity.

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- Wrote my first lines of code at **9 years old** using **FrontPage** and **Logo programming language**.
- Proud cat owner — my black cat often joins my coding sessions.
- Obsessed with productivity: I have an alias or shell script for almost everything.
