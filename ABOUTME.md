## 📘 Philosophy

> **Security comes from awareness, not rigidity.**

- **Sobriety without heaviness**: Elegant minimalism and clean spaces.
- **Naturalness without obviousness**: Earthy and muted tones, subtle design.
- **Discipline without rigidity**: Structured layouts with organic breathing room.

Presence that is:

- Calm but awake.
- Strong but adaptable.
- Sophisticated but accessible.

A direct translation of the **Zero Trust** mindset into aesthetics: trust nothing without verification, even in visuals.

## 🌟 Where I Am Now

> **Staff-level experience. Senior mindset. Junior hunger to learn.**

“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.” — Shunryu Suzuki, *Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind*

Still learning how to express many possibilities in just a few words — the paradox of a curious mind trying to speak in bullet points.

> *Experience, drive, and a curiosity that’s never left me.*

- Obsessed with productivity: I have an alias or shell script for almost everything.
